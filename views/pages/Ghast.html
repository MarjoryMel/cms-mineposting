In Minecraft, the Ghast is a large, hostile mob found in the Nether dimension. It resembles a ghostly, floating jellyfish with a sad face and emits eerie cries. Ghasts are known for their ability to shoot explosive fireballs at players, which can cause significant damage and set things on fire. They can be difficult to defeat due to their tendency to hover over lava lakes and their fireball attacks. When defeated, Ghasts drop gunpowder and Ghast tears, the latter of which is used in potion brewing. Their distinctive sound and powerful attacks make them one of the more challenging mobs in the Nether.
