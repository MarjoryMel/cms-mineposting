In Minecraft, the Creeper is an iconic and infamous hostile mob known for its silent approach and explosive nature. Creepers have a distinct appearance, characterized by their tall, green, cylindrical bodies and sad facial expression.

Creepers are unique because they do not make any noise when they move, making them difficult to detect until they are close. When they approach a player, they will hiss for a brief moment before detonating, causing significant damage to both the player and the surrounding environment. This explosion can destroy blocks, items, and structures, making Creepers a significant threat, especially near player-built areas.

Upon death, Creepers drop gunpowder, which is used in crafting items like TNT and fireworks. They can also rarely drop music discs if they are killed by a skeleton's arrow. The Creeper's ability to cause unexpected destruction has made it one of the most recognizable and feared mobs in Minecraft.
