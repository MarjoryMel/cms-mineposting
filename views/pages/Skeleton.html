In Minecraft, the Skeleton is a hostile mob that spawns in dark areas, such as caves or during the night. They are equipped with bows and shoot arrows at players and other mobs. Skeletons drop bones, arrows, and sometimes bows upon death. They are known for their distinct rattling sound and are a common threat to players exploring the game world. Skeletons can also ride spiders, forming a "Spider Jockey," and they can pick up and use weapons and armor dropped in the game.
