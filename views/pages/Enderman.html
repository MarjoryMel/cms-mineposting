In Minecraft, the Enderman is a tall, neutral mob with a slender, black appearance and glowing purple eyes, often compared to the mythical "Slenderman" due to its eerie behavior and design. Endermen are unique in that they can pick up and place blocks, and they are mostly peaceful unless provoked. They become hostile if a player looks directly at their face or attacks them.

Endermen can teleport short distances, making them difficult to defeat. When killed, they drop Ender Pearls, which are used for teleportation and are essential in crafting Eye of Ender items, which are necessary for locating and activating the End Portal to reach the End dimension. In the End, Endermen are much more common and play a significant role in the game's progression and lore.
